# Contrast Theme for VSCode

I wrote Contrast a couple years for Sublime. I waited to port it to VSCode for reasons [detailed in my blog post](https://john-dugan.com/contrast-theme/). The grammars in VSCode are still signifcantly lacking, but I _really_ like the editor. Almost all of my gripes (save grammars) have been resolved. As VSCode continues to improve language grammars, I will improve Contrast.

## Well Supported Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass (scss)
- JavaScript
- PHP
- JSON
- XML

Contrast **requires** the [Sublime Babel Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshpeng.sublime-babel-vscode) published by Josh Peng, which masks VSCode's craptastic JavaScript grammar. I will absolutely remove this dependency when the JavaScript grammar that ships with VSCode is sufficient.
