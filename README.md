# Contrast Theme for VSCode

[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/johndugan.contrast-theme.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johndugan.contrast-theme) [![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs/johndugan.contrast-theme.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johndugan.contrast-theme)

I originally wrote Contrast in 2015 for Sublime Text. I based it off the popular [1337 theme](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/1337/). When I ported it to VSCode in December of 2016, the language grammers were poor. Since then, the VSCode team has made tons of progress. And because of that, so has Contrast :-).

If you enjoy the theme, I'd appreciate you sharing it and/or giving it a positive rating!

## Well Supported Languages

I'm a frontend developer. The languages that I work with below have been meticulously scoped/tokenized/defined in Contrast. Other languages should work just fine too. Contrast significantly exceeds the minimum [scope coverage recommendation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html#color_schemes).

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass (scss)
- JavaScript
- PHP
- JSON
- XML
- Markdown

## Issues and Improvements

I plan to make some tweaks for React and JSX in the near future. If you find issues or inconsistencies, please get in touch on GitHub.
