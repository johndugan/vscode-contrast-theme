# Contrast Theme for VS Code

[![Version](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/johndugan.contrast-theme.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johndugan.contrast-theme) [![Installs](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/installs/johndugan.contrast-theme.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johndugan.contrast-theme)

I originally wrote Contrast in 2015 for Sublime Text. I based it off the popular [1337 theme](https://colorsublime.github.io/themes/1337/). When I ported it to VS Code in December of 2016, the language grammers were poor. Since then, the VS Code team has made tons of progress. And because of that, so has Contrast :-).

If you enjoy the theme, **I'd appreciate you sharing it and/or giving it a positive rating!**

## Well Supported Languages

I'm a frontend developer. The languages that I work with below have been meticulously scoped/tokenized/defined in Contrast. Other languages should work just fine too. Contrast significantly exceeds the minimum [scope coverage recommendation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html#color_schemes).

- HTML
- CSS
- Sass (scss)
- JavaScript
- PHP
- JSON
- XML
- Markdown

## Issues and Improvements

## Font Recommendation

Use whatever font you fancy. I fancy [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro "Source Code Pro on Google Fonts").
